                        <p>
                            I joined the <a href="https://aueb.gr/">AUEB</a> team back in 2017, four years have gone by since then and I've had the opportunity to work on lots
                            of very interesting projects along some very bright academics. Following are some of my personal favorite projects,projects that I had fun taking 
                            part in, despite all the hardships along the way. You can also find my Github profile by clicking <a href="https://github.com/svtvrn?tab=repositories">here</a>!

                        <p>
                            The first project I'd like to talk about is also probably my favorite one so far and it's the second assignment of the Artificial
                            Intelligence course. It focused on classic machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, decision trees, boosting ensembles and
                            regressions. Our task was to rebuild those algorithms from scratch the best we could, train them on a provided dataset and then
                            test how well we did using a testing dataset. My team and I managed to make 4 different algorithms and achieve really good accuracy
                            scores, matching the ones from the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Sklearn library</a> with just a slight difference
                            (mostly around 1-2%). Below you can see how well our Naive Bayes algorithm was able to classify the data.

                        <p>As you can see we were able to make our model predict with accuracy up to 84%, matching the Sklearn classifier!</p>

                        <h2 id="web">WebAudio Synthesizer</h2>
                        <p>
                            The second project I'll be showing off is a browser based application created with the help of the WebAudio API, a JavaScript
                            based library that helps developers add audio context to their websites. We went a step further beyond and created a modular
                            synthesizer for browsers, called Synthy Boi.

                        <p>
                            The app provided all the basic notes of the 4th octave plus the C note of the 5th octave. From there the user can modify the 
                            sound output however they please, from pretty basic features like changing the amplifier gain (volume) and the waveform type,
                            to more advanced options like ADSR envelope, control of the bass and treble frequencies, distortion and more. Further effects
                            like tremolo and vibrato where also added as well as an oscilloscope which allowed us to visualize the waveform as it's being
                            modified.

                        <h2 id="fridge">Smart Fridge GUI</h2>
                        <p>
                            For the final project I chose the smart fridge graphical user interface we developed for the Human Computer Interaction course.
                            This is a project in which we had the freedom to develop a GUI for any home appliance we wanted. Why a fridge out of all things
                            you might ask, well the choice mostly came down to 2 things: 1) No other team was developing a fridge GUI and 2) We thought it 
                            was also really fun to go a bit "over the top" for a fridge app, since even big companies like Samsung keep adding more ridiculous 
                            features to their fridges like <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/family-hub-refrigerator/overview/">cameras</a>. Due to 
                            time limitations we couldn't add a camera ourselves, but we did manage to create a note/drawing view for it  where the user can
                            keep notes or simply draw a funny cartoon. The project was developed for Android using the Android Studio platform under the name
                            UIce.

                            All the icons were created by me from scratch in Adobe XD, using the SVG format for rescalability and the highest image quality
                            possible.
